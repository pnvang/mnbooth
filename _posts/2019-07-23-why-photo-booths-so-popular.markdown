Here are 6 reasons why you should have a photo booth at your next event:

1 - **Entertainment.** Having a few activities besides dancing at your reception is a good way to make sure all your guests have fun. Sometimes people just want a break from busting a move, and the photo booth provides a nice escape. It’s also a good place for people to gather and socialize. Your guests will love it. We always have a queue to get into our booth and when guests come out they are always smiling; so much so they come back again and again!

2 - **It creates a great keepsake** — for you and your guests. People will appreciate having a photo of themselves with their friends, their kids, or their date. But even if they don’t care about that, you will love having fun pictures of your guests.

3 - **It’s suitable for all ages.** You don’t have to be young to enjoy a photo and your aunt might not want to dance to Rihanna! She might want to take this ‘photo opp’ with her niece and both of them have memory and print to share.

4 - **It’s a talking point.** Guests love to show others how their photos turn out and start conversations between people who may not know each other.

5 - **Makes an awesome scrapbook.** Though you might not even realize we’re doing this, you will be glad your booth butler took the time to make sure everyone adds a snap to your guest book while leaving a message around the photographs. It’s a new twist on the traditional guest books and one that you will want to look at again and again.

6 - **Share the love!** Not only will your guests receive a copy of the fun photographs at your event, but we will also upload all your ‘clean’ pictures to your very own Facebook album! This helps carry on the fun for weeks after the big day as friends and family tag, comment and copy their pictures.
